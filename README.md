kivy-sdk-packager
=================

`kivy-sdk-packager` is a collection of tools and scripts to build binaries 
needed by [Kivy framework](https://kivy.org) apps for different platforms.

>[!NOTE]
> The name has become a misnomer as the project has evolved; it is no longer
> about Software Development Kits.

The tools are intended to be run in automated build environments, including
Continuos Integration (CI) and Continuous Delivery (CD) tools.

Each platform targeted by the Kivy framework has its own needs. Hence, the 
scripts for each platform are quite different in scope. This repository 
contains scripts Windows, macOS and Linux.

For most platforms, this repository contains behind-the-scenes scripts. There is
no need for developers of Kivy apps to be aware of them.

macOS developers may want to use the scripts here for packaging, but it is 
recommended that they use [Buildozer](https://buildozer.readthedocs.io/)
instead. It encapsulates the use of `kivy-sdk-packager`.

You can find a detailed README.md document inside every platform folder.
They explain what the provided files do, what artefacts are produced, and what
steps are required for each new release.

kivy-sdk-packager is managed by the [Kivy Team](https://kivy.org/about.html).

## Linux (Debian)

Binaries for Linux are distributed as 
[Personal Package Archives](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/+ppas) (PPA) files.
They are built by Canonical and hosted on [Launchpad](https://launchpad.net/) to the
specifications (recipes) provided here.

| Version      | Binary                                                                                           | Source                                                                                          |

More information: [Linux README](linux/debian/README.md)

## macOS

Binaries for macOS are built as Disk Image (.DMG) or App (.APP) files.

These can be built on the developer's machine. 


[Buildozer](https://buildozer.readthedocs.io) encapsulates the use of 
kivy-sdk-packager so the Kivy app developer does not need to be concerned with
it.

More information: [macOS README](osx/README.md)

## Windows

Binaries for Windows are built as wheels that can be installed via 
[pip](https://pypi.org/project/pip/). They are uploaded and hosted on the 
[Python Package Index](https://pypi.org/) (PyPI).

Four variants are released - they contain support for different  
[OpenGL ES](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OpenGL_ES) implementations and other
libraries:

| Version                                                                 | PyPI Name                                                            |
